# BulletBillTrain

This is a very simple mod that offers an alternative to the diesel locomotive. This "bullet train" accelerates and decelerates faster than a standard locomotive, and has a slightly higher top speed.  It also burns through fuel twice as fast.

It's intended to make crossing the tracks on a yellow signal that little bit more terrifying. After all, if your base isn't trying to kill you, you're doing something wrong.
