Bullet Bill Train
v 0.0.3

This is a very simple mod that offers an alternative to the diesel
locomotive.  This "bullet train" accelerates and decelerates faster
than a standard locomotive, and has a slightly higher top speed.
It also burns through fuel twice as fast.

It's intended to make crossing the tracks on a yellow signal that
little bit more terrifying.  After all, if your base isn't trying
to kill you, you've done something wrong.
